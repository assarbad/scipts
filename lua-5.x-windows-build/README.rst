==========================
 premake4.lua for Lua 5.x
==========================

About
-----

The ``premake4.lua`` in this folder can be placed into the "root folder" which
contains the ``src/`` folder and you should be able to build a solution and
project from that.

I tried it with Lua 5.1.5, 5.2.4 and 5.3.1.

It's possible you'll need the premake4_ version that I patched for WinDirStat.
